0,"Lucky numbers can vary depending on the culture and context, but here are some commonly cited lucky numbers: 7 - Considered lucky in many cultures, including Western and Eastern traditions. 8 - Said to bring wealth and prosperity in Chinese culture. 3 - Considered lucky in many African cultures, as well as in Western traditions. 4 - Thought to bring good fortune and stability in many cultures. 1 - Considered lucky in some cultures, such as in the belief that the number one brings single-minded focus and determination. 5 - Said to bring change and new beginnings in many cultures. While these numbers are commonly cited as lucky, it's important to remember that luck is subjective and can vary from person to person. What one person considers lucky may not be the same for another. Ultimately, the power of luck comes from within and is influenced by one's mindset and actions.",74.74558997154236,2.1004583689790137,1.497690200805664,12452.52,21.57,215,9965.24,12452.45,11,0.88,61893.24,214,3.46,74738.27,225,2024-10-22 10:35:00
1,"Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 0 and 1. They have been observed in nature since ancient times, and have been studied extensively in mathematics. Fibonacci numbers appear in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, geometry, number theory, and topology. They also occur in many real-world situations, such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the flowering of artichokes, and the structure of pineapples. One reason for the ubiquity of Fibonacci numbers is their ability to model certain patterns and structures found in nature. For example, the spiral of a nautilus shell or the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower can be approximated using Fibonacci numbers. Additionally, Fibonacci numbers have many interesting properties, such as the fact that they approach the golden ratio, which is an irrational number that has many unique properties. Another reason for the prevalence of Fibonacci numbers is their connection to the golden ratio, which is believed to have aesthetic appeal. Many artists and designers have used the golden ratio in their work, and it is thought to be an important element of beauty and balance in many forms of art and design.",77.55592393875122,2.9011323516394545,1.497690200805664,12452.52,26.61,297,11159.96,2753.54,21,7.63,74310.35,296,3.98,77526.12,317,2024-10-22 10:36:18
